# Kadir Akbudak, PhD in Computer Science
 Welcome! 
I am currently working as a PostDoc researcher at KAUST.  My main research area is parallel scientific computing.
I have expertise on:

   * data partitioning and task mapping/scheduling for exascale applications
   * locality aware partitioning and scheduling of irregular applications
   * parallel programming (on IBM BlueGene/P,Q and other parallel systems)
   * cache-aware methods and programming for scientific computational kernels
